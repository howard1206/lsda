Modification on Large Scale Detection through Adaptation

You can download the pre-trained model and detectors on https://goo.gl/V8CBl2

Remember to link your local caffe to external/caffe

If you want to accerate the imresize of matlab native API, you could consider to use GPU acceration, which I cite from https://github.com/aosokin/cropRectanglesMex here.
